```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## introdution 
this is the linear model with prediction problem.
predict strength scores using data from the following website.


```{r}
dataF <- read.csv(file="http://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt", sep= "" ,header=TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
require (rgl)
require(knitr)
require(ggplot)
```

### PLOT SCATTERPLOT




## Now add the model fit to our plot




## Compare the two models. Note ADJR r2 larger residual SE is smaller in model.2



## conclusion
